Assignments for Neural Network module CZ4042

**Assignment 1**
1. This question requires us to build neural networks in classifying the Cardiotocography dataset. It contains measurements of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) features on 2126 cardiotocograms classified by expert obstetricians [1]. The dataset can be obtained from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cardiotocography.
<br>

2. This assignment uses the data from the Graduate Admissions Predication [2]. We investigate features that are considered important during the application for Master Programs. The predicted parameter is the chance of getting an admit (ranging from 0 to 1). Data can be obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions


<br>


**Assignment 2**
1. We implement Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object detection on CIFAR-10 dataset, containing RGB colour images of size 32 X 32 and their labels from 0 to 9. Data obtained from: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
<br>

2. We use text collected from Wikipage entries and the corresponding labels about their category, and implement CNN and RNN layers at the word and character levels for the classification of texts in the paragraphs.
